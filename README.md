# Computer

These are the schematics for an 8-bit computer I'm designing, loosely based [Ben Eater's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).

There's a pdf version of the schematics [here](schematic.pdf), although it might not always be up to date. Otherwise, you can open the project in [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/).
